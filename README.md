# EEG_pipeline
Adaptation, step-by-step, of the BrainDecode repository. The goal is to use edf files as input and perform various ML tasks on them. 

As of right now, I am focusing on adjusting the input pipeline. As such, I am re-doing and checking the validity of the datasets directory in the BrainDecode project (https://github.com/braindecode/braindecode/tree/master/braindecode). 

Several changes, additions and deletions have already been implemented. I will try to add jupyter notebooks to showcase changes or issues.
